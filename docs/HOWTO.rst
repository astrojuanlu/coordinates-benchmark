Astropy coordinates benchmark HOWTO
===================================

Setting up an environment to run the benchmarks
-----------------------------------------------

If you want to set up a virtual environment to run the benchmarks, you can do::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install "numpy<1.18" Cython jinja2
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running
-------

Go to the repository top-level folder (where the ``./make.py`` file is).
The ``./make.py`` command line tool gives you access to all functionality.

To print its help message which lists all sub-commands run::

    ./make.py

To run the benchmarks (output goes in ``output/tools``)::

    ./make.py benchmark-celestial

To generate a summary webpage (output goes in ``output``)::

    ./make.py summary-celestial

To generate a ton of plots for the webpage (optional) (output goes in ``output/plots``)::

    ./make.py plots

Checking
--------

The benchmark results are stored in this repository and have been obtained on one machine,
but it's easy for anyone to re-run (and should be re-run from time to time, especially
after changes in the ``astropy.coordinates`` code).

To check if benchmark or summary output matches results previously obtained,
use ``git diff output/tools`` and ``git diff output/summary.txt``.

TODO: describe how many decimal digits we store and why that
a) is enough precision (< milli-arcsec)
b) should be the same on any 64-bit computer


Deploying
---------

To deploy the latest results to Github pages::

    ./make.py deploy

and if there are no errors::

    git push upstream gh-pages
